    # -----------------
    # Takes |self.belief| -- an object of class Belief, defined in util.py --
    # and updates it in place based on the distance observation $d_t$ and
    # your position $a_t$.

    # Notes:
    # - Convert row and col indices into locations using util.rowToY and util.colToX.
    # - util.pdf: computes the probability density function for a Gaussian
    # - Although the gaussian pdf is symmetric with respect to the mean and value,
    #   you should pass arguments to util.pdf in the correct order
    # - Don't forget to normalize self.belief after you update its probabilities!

    # Part 2:
    # Function: Elapse Time (propose a new belief distribution based on a learned transition model)
    # ---------------------
    # Takes |self.belief| and updates it based on the passing of one time step.
    # Notes:
    # - Use the transition probabilities in self.transProb, which is a dictionary
    #   containing all the ((oldTile, newTile), transProb) key-val pairs that you
    #   must consider.
    # - If there are ((oldTile, newTile), transProb) pairs not in self.transProb,
    #   they are assumed to have zero probability, and you can safely ignore them.
    # - Use the addProb (or setProb) and getProb methods of the Belief class to modify
    #   and access the probabilities associated with a belief.  (See util.py.)
    # - Be careful that you are using only the CURRENT self.belief distribution to compute
    #   updated beliefs.  Don't incrementally update self.belief and use the updated value
    #   for one grid square to compute the update for another square.
    # - Don't forget to normalize self.belief after all probabilities have been updated!
    #   (so that the sum of probabilities is exactly 1 as otherwise adding/multiplying
    #    small floating point numbers can lead to sum being close to but not equal to 1)

    # Part 3-1:
    # Function: Observe:
    # -----------------
    # Takes |self.particles| and updates them based on the distance observation
    # $d_t$ and your position $a_t$.
    #
    # This algorithm takes two steps:
    # 1. Re-weight the particles based on the observation.
    #    Concept: We had an old distribution of particles, and now we want to
    #             update this particle distribution with the emission probability
    #             associated with the observed distance.
    #             Think of the particle distribution as the unnormalized posterior
    #             probability where many tiles would have 0 probability.
    #             Tiles with 0 probabilities (i.e. those with no particles)
    #             do not need to be updated.
    #             This makes particle filtering runtime to be O(|particles|).
    #             By comparison, the exact inference method (used in Part 1 + 2)
    #             assigns non-zero (though often very small) probabilities to most tiles,
    #             so the entire grid must be updated at each time step.
    # 2. Re-sample the particles.
    #    Concept: Now we have the reweighted (unnormalized) distribution, we can now
    #             re-sample the particles from this distribution, choosing a new grid location
    #             for each of the |self.NUM_PARTICLES| new particles. To be extra clear: these
    #             new NUM_PARTICLES should be sampled from the new re-weighted distribution,
    #             not the old belief distribution, with replacement so that more than
    #             one particle can be at a tile
    #
    # - agentX: x location of your car (not the one you are tracking)
    # - agentY: y location of your car (not the one you are tracking)
    # - observedDist: true distance plus a mean-zero Gaussian with standard deviation Const.SONAR_STD
    #
    # Notes:
    # - Remember that |self.particles| is a dictionary with keys in the form of
    #   (row, col) grid locations and values representing the number of particles at
    #   that grid square.
    # - In order to work with the grader, you must create a new dictionary when you are
    #   re-sampling the particles, then set self.particles equal to the new dictionary at the end.
    # - Create |self.NUM_PARTICLES| new particles during resampling.
    # - To pass the grader, you must call util.weightedRandomChoice() once per new
    #   particle.  See util.py for the definition of weightedRandomChoice().
    # - Although the gaussian pdf is symmetric with respect to the mean and value,
    #   you should pass arguments to util.pdf in the correct order
